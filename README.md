Harlem-Shake
============

This is an iOS app to create your own Harlem Shake videos.

I made this as an attempt to cash in on Harlem Shake craze.  I was trying to make something functional in as little time as possible (to be the first to the store.)  This was my first experience splicing video/audio together using fairly arcane APIs; *it is probably the most terrifying code ever written*.
